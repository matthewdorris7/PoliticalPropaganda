Did Russia interfere with the 2016 Election?

## Background Information
The 2016 election marked the first time a foreign nation was suspected of tampering with and influencing US citizens through Social Media. Our dataset pertains directly to this issue, all of these ads are sourced by the cryptic Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Moscow-backed group that sought to sow discontent and misinformation during the presidential election.

## Description of Dataset:
The dataset contains social media data, specifically Facebook and Twitter data, that the Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence of the US House of Representatives deemed sourced by the cryptic Internet Research Agency (IRA). The Facebook data provided advertisement text, data on ad social engagement, amount of money spent per advertisement, and other advertisement related data.

## My Role on the Team
Which political ideology are the advertisements meant to support?

## Conclusion
We were able to conclude that an outside entity, specifically we believe to be the Russia's Internet Research Agency, was responsible for posting the Ads that disproportionately targeted African Americans and primarily focused on Liberal Ideologies as the content of their ads.
