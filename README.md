Did Russia interfere with the 2016 Election?



# Description of Dataset:
The dataset contains social media data, specifically Facebook and Twitter data, that the Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence of the US House of Representatives deemed to be connected to a well-known Russian
“troll” farm called the Internet Research Agency (IRA). The Facebook data provided advertisement text, data on ad
social engagement, amount of money spent per advertisement, and other advertisement related data.

#My Role on the Team
Which political ideology are the advertisements meant to support?
