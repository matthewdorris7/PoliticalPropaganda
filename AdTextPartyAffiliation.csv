Conservative,"NOT EVERY BOY WANTS TO BE A SOLDIER. A beautiful message was seen on the streets of the capitol,. with no group name or credits attached to the project. It was the poster at top, of the bearded man in a pink gown behaving like a queen and holding a sign saying ""Not every boy wants to be a soldier"". A timely message for today. The two recent U.S. wars were costly for our nation; to put it lightly. They led to domestic devastation of country. No matter what Defense Secretary or POTUS are saying they don't fool me with promises of gay military equality as key to the nation's agenda. Better talk to me about cutting DoD's budget. FOLKS. #Igbt #USarmy #CrossDress #GaySoldier #Obama #DefenseBudget #StopWar"

Liberal,"Since 2010, over 350 of our lives have been taken at the hands of police. Those lives of which, were made to be worthless because of our race. Each time we die, many of your people, and those who stand by you, justify the taking of our lives, because they believe we are not human, and are not worthy of life. Why should we be a target for police violence and harassment?"
Conservative,"'Just like Trayvon Martin, race mattered for Amadou Diallo, Oscar Grant, Sean Bell, Emmett Till, and [thousands] more we will never know the name of who died because of their skin color."" - Angela Davis.        Racism is still alive in the USA."
Conservative,"Race war started by Texas teacher A Texas fourth-grade teacher Karen Fitzgibbons published a racial Facebook post in which she confirmed that Black people are responsible for racial tensions in the USA. Moreover she claimed that she is ""almost to the point"" of defending the segregation. After her post about the recent pool party incident drew local attention, the teacher deleted her profile. ""This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I'm going to just go ahead and say it....the blacks are the ones causing the problems and this ̀ racial tension. I guess that's what happens when you flunk out of school and have no education. I'm sure their parents are just as guilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn't care,"" she wrote. She also added,""I'm almost to the point of wanting them all segregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the innocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something. Now, let the bashing of my true and honest opinion begin .... GO! #imnotracist #imsickofthemcausingtrouble #itwasagatedcommunity"". As we see Karen Fitzgibbons is a real racist, who approves the humiliation of black people! This news clearly reflects that American society is close to collapse, if not to say to war. As the authorities are doing nothing to resolve the situation, in the near future we may face real race war within our country."
Liberal,"The image of 1938 shows several African American Youths dangling around the stairs leading up to the back entrance of a segregated movie theater in Anniston, Alabama.That day the Tarzan film, Call of the Savage was shown."
Liberal,"American Racists On The Road        The racists group of America ""Back To The Blue"" are organizing a hate rally in response to the public outcry and protests against police officers. ""Bikers-patriots"" want to descend on the McKinney Police HQ in a show of solidarity for the police because race-baiters and cop-haters. They plan to have ""the biggest thing to happen in Patriot Movement since the Bundy Ranch victory!"" It seems like we won't get into ""post-racial America"".... this event and the regular murder of innocent Black children by white supremacist police and citizens makes that clear. The modern government has brought racist America to the forefront, good or bad. This is something that America has a serious issue with - RACISM! Is it time to call out the national guard?"

Liberal,"A woman pretended Afro-American to gain control over black community association The president of a local NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington is under investigation after her parents publicly accused her of lying being African American. Both parents of Rachel Dolezal are white. Rachel Dolezal also serves as the chair of Spokane's Office of Police Ombudsman Commission and is an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University. Dolezal falsely identified herself as African-American in order to be appointed as a chair. Dolezal's parents paid attention to the official documents, including a birth certificate, confirming that Rachel is part Swedish, Czech, and German with ""traces"" of Native American heritage. We see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black organization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In the Dolezal's case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community in order to control it and hold the interests of white majority. We need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal's activities while she was a president of the local branch of the Association of black people! In order not to repeat similar cases in future we need a careful control of all appointments by black community! As it is, there is a dominance of whites in police departments and authorities of cities with a predominantly black population!"
Liberal,"2Pac believed in Fight Tupac Shakur was indeed not just one of the greatest rappers of all time but a worldly icon whose status in hip-hop culture can never be replaced. His revolutionary knowledge mixed with street experience made him powerful unstoppable force that spoke to the hearts of millions of people. His songs touch on a number of engaging topics, including religion, women, oppression, etc. 2Pac was a humanitarian, who stood up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. He believed in Fight and Speaking the Truth. Nowadays a lot of singers, both black and white use their music to sell records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary citizens. On the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That's why he spoke to issues of poverty, oppression and racism. Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money, drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government's attitude towards Blacks. But let's remember Tupac and his ability to question the social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to change their lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each other and to learn to love each other."
Liberal,"Today we celebrate the legendary rapper who ever lived: Happy B-day, Tupac! The greatest of all time rapper is known not only for his music but for the wise words he spoke and his strength in standing up against oppression. His real name was Lesane Parish Crooks. Shakur was only 25 years old at the time he was shot and killed in 1996. His killer has never been caught. We will never forget 2Pac. Today we remember him on what would've been his 44th Birthday."
Liberal,It is an American history. African-American citizens sat behind signs like these on city buses.
Liberal,Americans so much effort to hate each other instead of putting the effort into doing something useful. Stop racism! We all belong to ONE HUMAN RACE.
Liberal,"No national outrage for an incident at pool party where a black teen was shot to death        Today, the pool party in Georgia is even more shocking than a recent pool party in Texas. A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager's pool party which ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager Clanton passed away on the way to hospital. In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident. Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black teenager dies? Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the shootings at the average pool party."
Liberal,"A 13-year-old child was tasered by cop for skateboarding        A San Diego sheriff's deputy was filmed tasering 13-year-old child in the spine for skateboarding. Witnesses reported that the cop tried to force them to delete videos from their phones. Videos show how the child writhes in agony from being tased. Police said that the child ran away from home and was missing for a day-and-half. However it doesn't give the reason to taser a child. We see another case of police misconduct, when the policeman actually attacked the child. This case should reach the court, because the child hasn't done anything unlawful. The policeman exceeded his powers and used force against a child. So he should be punished. Before the trial nothing's gonna change and cops are about to do whatever they want. The task of all Americans who have witnessed police brutality is to extend all the information about it in order to reach out the government and the court."
Liberal,"Only 9 days this year nobody was killed by police        According to data from Mapping Police Violence there are only 9 days this calendar year when nobody was killed by police in the USA. Since January 1, 2015 at least 508 people have now been killed by policemen. Moreover, analyzing all deaths caused by police, African-American and Hispanic people are more likely to be killed than Whites. Figures show that the index of deaths for black people is 3.45 per million, while for whites it is 1.26 per million. Add here military-style equipment and non-lethal weapons, given to cops. And only 0.02 per cent of the nation's police forces are investigated each year. Only 0.02! That means, US policemen are immune from criminal changes in their killings. That's why they carry out their daily police raids to destroy the population at the territories under their control."
Liberal,"In early 1900s this Black Americana Chocolate Eyes Ad Art was popular in the USA. They made money from our pain and suffering! Though today we don't see such ads, racism still exists in the American society."
Liberal,"Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone *CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE* A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore? #CharlestonShooting #chsnews"
Conservative,"Rachel Dolezal is wearing the other persons shoes. Rachel Dolezal drew attention to her racial identification. A white-born former NAACP leader claimed to be black. The criticism towards Dolezal stems controversy around her identity and her position as the president of the NAACP in Washington. Today. Dolezal sees herself as first transracial. Rachel Dolezal stated that her racial identity was black, American Indian; white and two more races. Moreover if she proves that she is black; than anyone else will be able to prove that he/she is not even a human being. What do you think about her? What kind of rights should she have?"
Liberal,"The violent pool story #3. White police officer slammed black teen against his        car This black family from Ohio will never forget the June 9th. According to the family's testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight children, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield. Nevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of the children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon walked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an ID-card. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed Dixon's family and grabbed 12-year-old child by neck. But according to the Fairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive force. Did the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race factor? Don't you think the police officer's attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was unlawful? How the police officers should be charged? What kind of right of defense do you have against unlawful arrests? These days, there is far more to being a ""good cop"" than choosing not to hurt innocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even today, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America transmitted through music, lyrics, titles, literature, movies and folk saying. White Americans across the country embrace African-Americans the image of criminals and looters. How are we going to live with that?"
Conservative,What else has to happen for you all to realize black lives matter?
Liberal,"Thousands Walk Hand In Hand Across Ravenel Bridge To Show Support For Mother Emanuel Church On Sunday evening, hours after Emanuel A.M.E. Church opened its doors for the first service following the killing of nine of its congregants Wednesday, thousands in Charleston took to the streets in a show of support and solidarity. Observers on the bridge, and thousands more at the base, joined hands to create a ""unity chain,"" then held a moment of silence that lasted five minutes in honor of the fallen. Police estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 took part in Sunday's gathering, according to the Post and Courier. Cars drove slowly past the bridge, taking in the sight and honking horns in solidarity as people chanted ""Charleston strong!"" Throughout history people start to unite only when they face danger or when they're in times of great sorrow. Modern America is accustomed to meet only imaginary dangers, however, Americans are getting more and more reasons to sorrow over something day by day. Does it mean that the key to the unity of 330 million Americans is constant fear and unending sorrow? Does it mean that only this can make Americans unite and forget about the infighting and differences? Unfortunately, yes, it does."
Conservative,"Whatever the white man has done. Black Americans have done, and often even better. Miss Black America in 1969."
Liberal,"How many of you believe in Black Jesus?        There is quite a big number of people arguing about ethnicity of Jesus Christ. Was Jesus white, olive-skinned or black? The Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt owns the earliest painting of Jesus Christ in the Church of Rome (6th century) where skin color of Jesus was black."
Conservative,Black is beautiful. God knows what he is doing. The Black skin is a glorious symbol of national greatness.
Liberal,"A small group of activists burned two confederate flags in response to shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.        Why the symbol of the pro-slavery rebellion is still flying on the ground of South Carolina? Why the symbol of white supremacy is still flying on the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia? Why the flag that represents the murder of blacks was not removed from the national statehouse? The confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery time, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations. We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to Andrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned slaves on their farms. How can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show ourselves to be men the same as any other race of men?"
Liberal,Such a beautiful day! Such a beatiful view!
Conservative,"McKinney Police Officer Involved In Pool Party Incident        Eric Casebolt, the McKinney, police officer who was caught on video pinning a teenage girl to the ground and pulling his gun on others at a pool party, has resigned Tuesday evening. The McKinney Police Department, Chief Of Police Greg Conley said that Casebolt's decision to leave was voluntary and that he would continue to collect a pension and benefits. Why are the police so aggressive? It's in every state around the country. The young girl at the pool party was treated horrible. Our society needs police, good police, people who will solve crimes but, unfortunately, today we need someone who will protect us from the police. At the same time, it is good that millions of regular people got a glimpse of what kind of policing minorities have endured for decades."

Liberal,"Cornel West on Obama: ""The First Black President Has Become The First Niggerized Black President""        Reacting to President Obama's use of the n-word on Marc Maron's podcast, Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy."" ""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said we have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America but white supremacy is American as cherry pie."" West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and 2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The number is horrific."
Conservative,"Autopsy Says Freddie Gray Died After Sustaining 'High-Energy Injury' in Police Van        The Baltimore state medical examiner's office has found that Freddie Gray likely died from a single ""high-energy injury"" sustained as he rode shackled in the back of a police van on the day of his arrest, according to an autopsy report obtained by the Baltimore Sun. The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so. It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something? Cops imprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you to war, keep you poor, call you a thug and get away with it. There's no excuse for what happened to Freddie."
Liberal,"Ella Baker. The woman behind the scenes. Not many of you will probably be able to recognize Ella Baker, who was a hero of the civil rights Freedom Movement, racial and economic injustice for five decades.

Liberal,"Philosophy of African-American activist Huey Newton        Huey Newton was an African-American political activist and a leader of generation of black, best known for founding the militant Black Panther Party in 1966. As a child, Newton experienced racial discrimination that influenced him to create the Black Panther Party as a voice of black people. His party grew up to a size of 5,000 full time party workers in 45 branches across America and inspired generation in North America to join the struggle against oppression. But he was shot to death in August 1989."
Liberal,"More riots are coming this summer ... unless What is the most important thing the government must to do this year in order our country to live in peace? The criminal justice system is very important institution where law enforcement investigate a crime gathering evidences to identify the presumed perpetrator ensuring that rights of the convicted are respected. But what if American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a renewed sense of justice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main challenge of the criminal justice system? Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of America. Consequently, the victim's skin color plays a crucial role in deciding what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots, then they must think about the living standards of black population that is several times below the living standards of white people in America. In addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black population by revising the hiring policy for black Americans. Therefore, if we want a life's balance, the government have to reconsider all these things, because Black Americans lives matter."
Liberal,"Fifty years ago, 48% of African American adults and 57% of African American children lived in poverty. Today, only 28% of African American adults and 38% of African American children live in poverty. We've come so far, but still there is a long way to go."

Conservative,"Republican strategist Karl Rove said on ""Fox News Sunday"" the only way to stop gun-related violence, like the Wednesday massacre at Emmanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston S.C., was to repeal American citizens' Second Amendment rights. It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier. The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't matter. The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It's pity when some politicians think otherwise. People should understand that a gun is not a killing tool, it's self-defense tool. And we will stand for our right to keep and bear arms!"
Liberal,"The Chinese hackers executed a complex attack that gave them ""administrator privileges"" into the computer networks at the Office of Personnel Management, mimicking the credentials of people who run the agency's systems. They began siphoning out a rush of data after constructing what amounted to an electronic pipeline that led back to China, investigators told Congress last week in classified briefings.        Much of the personnel data had been stored in the lightly protected systems of the Department of the Interior, because it had cheap, available space for digital data storage. The administration is urgently working to determine what other agencies are storing similarly sensitive information with weak protections. Officials would not identify their top concerns, but an audit issued early last year, before the Chinese attacks, harshly criticized lax security at the Internal Revenue Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Energy Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission — and the Department of Homeland Security, which has responsibility for securing the nation's critical networks.

The war that is called the ""Civil War"" was actually the ""War for Southern Independence"". This is our history and our heritage.

Conservative,"Why do immigrants think that the U.S. government should create good conditions for them? I think immigrants should prove that they are deserved to stay in the United States. Why should we give a citizenship to those who cannot give something good for the nation? The worst thing is that illegal immigrants who broke the law to live in the United States demand ask for indulgences. What nonsense! Illegals should be deported from the country invariably. But Obama's administration is tied to the chariot of immigrants. Democrats know that immigrants will vote for the Democratic party. Especially former illegals. That's why Barack Obama tries to give the Immigration Amnesty to illegals as soon as possible. It will allow to increase a number of votes for a Democratic Party presidential candidate in 2016. And democrats don't care about the fact that most of immigrants will become welfare recipients, increasing unemployment rate. America doesn't need immigrants, democrats do. What's more important: to win Presidential elections in 2016 or to make America better? Democrats seem to choose first option. That's what differs republicans from democrats."

Liberal,"NOM'S LAST ATTEMPT TO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets.       That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states — so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it! There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they worked for made anyone's life better. At all. They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable. And when they're dead and gone, they'll be remembered only as footnotes in shameful history — or more likely they'll be forgotten completely. #LGBT #NOM #SameSexMarriage #Marriage #SCOTUS #equality"

But now that she's a star in 'Orange is the New Black', the popularity of this model, actress, and VJ has grown worldwide.        ""Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender,"" - Rose said; - ""I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born one. As a little kid, I was convinced that I was a guy. Then in my teens, I tried to be quite feminine ... And after a little bit, chopped everything off and am kind of back where I started. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes."" #Igbt #RubyRose #GenderFluidity #lesbian #OrangelsTheNewBlack"

Conservative,"The ninth transgender was found death in the USA Transgender teen Mercedes Williamson was found dead in a wooded area. She is the ninth confirmed transgender homicide victim in the USA this year. Police in George County. Mississippi have charged a suspect Josh Brandon Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was transgender. Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in 1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call `freedom'? America is no longer land of freedom!"

'I spent the majority of my life lying, hiding and depressed because I felt like I couldn't truly be who I wanted to be and live freely as I saw fit. I had to act and that's not me. I, nor anyone else, should have to do that.' Matt decided to tell the truth publicly because of speculation that was going behind his back.

The act also will outlaw advocating gay rights to minors. California Attorney General Kamala Harris claimed that the proposal was unconstitutional and it had no place in civil society. The proposal reminds me the Inquisition. We live in a free and tolerate country! So even talks about such an initiative should be immediately stopped. Where is our President? Stop considering gays as naughty and not like all the others. We are all equal. Despite all the arguments that the opponents of gay marriage call, polls show that the majority of Americans stand for gay marriages. Why not to hold a referendum as the Irish did?

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders  without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting's longstanding  policy of chartered organizations selecting their leaders.  The Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay adults has stood as a towering  example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America's most  important and recognizable civic organizations.

Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army.

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing  their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is  the biggest mistake!

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat. The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation. This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever, but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable?

Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

Liberal,"Another Woman Commits Suicide In Jail       A teen committed suicide in a jail cell an hour after being arrested, another suspicious case of a Black woman dying in police custody in the past week. The second case over a week, huh? How retarded and/or brainwashed by Fox News is one supposed to be to believe this is a coincidence? No way we are gonna buy such bullshit. The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing someone's phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account. We've got to also take into consideration that 1 in 3 black men go to prison as opposed to a considerably lower rate with the white men (http://www.alternet. org/story/154587/1 _in_3_black_men_g(:_to_prison_the_10_most_disturbing_ facts_about racial_inequality_in_the_u.s._criminal_justice_system). It definitely seems like there's more to this since until recently taking into custody hasn't been a reason for suicide among black women. Now for some people the only way to deal with police violence at the police stations is simply killing themselves..."

Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire outside a relative's home where Amari and other children were playing, hitting both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the chest. No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in. How can we feel safe here in America? Permanent threat to life follows every American like a shadow. What did this boy do to deserve a bullet in his body? He just played with his friends outdoor.

Liberal,"A number of refugees has increased since Obama became the President        States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama became the President. The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida (21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421). Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened. We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism, law enforcement system and so on. Is it possible to offer a better life for refugees if not all US citizens live normally?"
Conservative,"The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base, which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million.        Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We don't hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the world, but we cannot allow them to stay here.

This statement sounds strange on the background of rapproachment between Obama's administration and Tehran.        Although, this rapproachment in itself looks strange. We would remind you that Tehran has never expressed its condolences for the Iran hostage crisis. Moreover, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Hosseini Khamenei is too disrespectful to the United States despite of friendly actions of Obama's administration. And Iranian military command claims that Iran is ready to come into collision with America at any moment. The Iran deal is a shame of the United States. Senate Republicans were right when they expressed their distrust of Iranian government. It's not clear why Obama has refused containment of Iran that is an potential enemy not only for the United States, but also for the rest world. Barack Obama is, by all appearances, a true traitor of the United States. And it's not empty words — the rapprochement with Iran is either a treachery or stupidness."

Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his letter the terrorist didn't refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own volition. We don't want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam, according to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live comfortable together. And on the other hand, Muslims won't tend to radical activities and the destruction of peaceful life of Americans."

Some of them present the KKK's rally against the removal of the Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag. It is a very clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races. The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we should clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn't refuse our history and our traditions."
Conservative,"The U.S. flag hasn't been lowered in honor of the murdered Marines        Monday morning, July 20, the US flag continued to fly at the top of the White House and the US capitol building despite the fact that a gunman killed five US Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn. President Obama hasn't ordered to lower a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon, the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service members murdered in Tennessee. By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then decided to kill in the name of Allah. In general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do not even bother to learn English, because it's enough to speak Spanish, has increased."

People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth. Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth.

Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does is enable anti-gay discrimination. Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against religious institutions —for discriminating against people in same-sex marriages. It's the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them. Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that we have full Federal civil rights now. Or don't!

In fact, they have actually invented a new claim about how these bakers' ""free speech"" is under attack and how they're thus the real victims. There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do business with the public!

Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians, especially those who support marriage equality.

Conservative,"Controversy surrounding the flag only heats animosity among Americans. And it is becoming dangerous.        So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family. ""He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,"" Mark Wilson said. When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a flag of England or France. Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political correctness because George Washington owned slaves. Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to eliminate the party.

Liberal,"Most parents aren't prepared for the words, ""Mom, Dad. I'm gay."" For many  parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The  answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help  to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your  continued relationship with your son or daughter.  Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their  child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as  problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during  that time.  Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're  hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you  choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the  impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want  for dinner?"").  Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If  you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you  would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept  secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.  It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because  homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment  for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of  telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".  On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding  and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is  she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!  DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!  #children #lgbt #momdadimgay #gayisok #comingout #acceptance"

Chief Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell's dismissal he filed a complaint on unequal employment opportunities claiming he was paid less than his white predecessors. This is circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts based on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are treated unfairly.

Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said. And now there are three main points that you should think of: 1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo State University. Never was involved in criminal activities. 2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and was working under the supervision of a training officer. 3) Taylor didn't want to die young.

First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI.

In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was created in Washington, D.C. There the names of 57,939 American armed forces killed or missing during the war are inscribes. Latter the total additions brought to 58,267."

Almost half of students are served in our program for English as a second language, so it will take years before some students master the language. Immigrants use every excuse why they can't learn: poverty, racism, too much homework, the list is endless. The main question is why do American taxpayers should pay and take responsibility to provide translators for folks who don't make an effort to learn and speak English? This is unfair that those kids whose parents chose to immigrate here (most illegally) are all on welfare. They know they don't have to work, because the government will take care of them. So, if the government continues to keep the same standards for illegal immigrants, America will become another 3rd world country."

Well, this story clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man willing to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn't care about its soldiers, even if they are heroes.

The whole cruel, corrupted system is against her. It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must be ""broken"" or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she exposed the government's crimes, and government really doesn't like it, and second, because she's trans. Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's clear who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic character.

Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left unconscious. Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong. Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions or feelings of others, according to his mother.

Liberal,"Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41 percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory.        Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long- term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions."

R.I.P to all innocent victims, workers, police officers, firefighters and even dogs that died in this tragedy. This is a day in our history that everyone is going to remember. Today we should honor the memory of the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11? I'd like to tell you #My911 Story. I was only 15 when the attacks occurred. I was at school. I remember that somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC. We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took responsibility for the attacks. And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11? #My911 Story"

Conservative,"Vatican Says Transgender Man Cannot Become A Godparent        The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying out the task. Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender identity. Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery. Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote to the Vatican for advice. Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish. It said transsexual behavior ""reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality."" The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time, the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just another superstition of Church. Funny."
Conservative,"Gay the force be with you: Star Wars soldier comes out        Hero soldier Sinjir Rath Velus comes out in a new novel, which is part of the smash hit sci-fi franchise with arch-baddie Darth Vader. The space warrior appears in Star Wars: Aftermath, which bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and new film The Force Awakens. Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker's Rebellion, is the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to chat him up. Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: ""I don't think his sexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it's part of who he is. Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the creators of the new ""Star Wars"" for the incredible courage and opposition to conservative bias in Hollywood cinema. There should be a special organization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There should be at least one gay character in every movie in order to help the American society get rid of homophobic stereotypes."

Liberal,"The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall. Organizers of the Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks, Latinos and incarcerated. They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say ""black lives matter"", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on American extremists to execute him. There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice."
Liberal,"The Justice Department is set to release about 6,000 inmates from federal prisons in a bid to reduce overcrowding. It is the largest one-time release of federal prisoners. The Department will release drug offenders who received harsh sentences over the last three decades. Every third of them is illegal immigrant.        Barack Obama has criticized overblown sentencing laws that ""disproportionately impact communities of color."" But is it indeed a reason to release criminals? If Latinos commit crimes often than whites, it doesn't mean that some Latino criminals should escape penalty."

I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken Windows."" This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country. Like and share if you want to help the movement!"
Liberal,"Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead        Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition. One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34, and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help. It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh, wait. White male though... #UCC #Oregon #shooting"
Conservative,"Sometimes people say I criticize the government too much. They say I can't see positive moments. In fact, I see all good things in the United States, and I'm proud to be an American. But I reckon that I can't have the right to keep silence when outrageous things happen.        I can't keep silence while stupid idiots forbid our children to wear patriotic clothes. I can't keep silence while Obama creates comfortable conditions for terrorists, accepting of 10,000 Syrian refugees. I can't keep silence while liberals spit on the U.S. Constitution. Yes, I criticize everything what is unacceptable for the nation. If Americans turn a blind eye to outrageous things, enjoying only positive moments of their lives, we will never live better. Criticism is a way for development. I'm a patriot, that's why I criticize."
Conservative,"Common response after the massacre in Oregon is ̀ I Want to Have a Gun'.        ""I want to have a gun in the house to protect myself, to protect the people I'm with. I'm sure I'll have a normal life and never have to go through anything like this, but I want to be sure,"" said Mr. Vicari, 19. The right to bear arms allows the people to protect themselves. Gun control will deprive them this opportunity. And criminals will buy a firearm illegally. I don't know why some liberals are not able to understand it. Anyway, patriots stand for the 2nd amendment. We will never allow them to repeal or amend it!"
Conservative,"You know the Second Amendment is our unalienable right to bear arms that was granted Americans by the Founding Fathers. However, liberals just spit on the U.S. Constitution. So, Hillary Clinton said it's ""worth considering"" a nationwide gun ban and a ""buyback"" program to eradicate private gun ownership.        Hillary says she is a democrat. Huh! No, she like Obama should say they're socialists who want to set up tyranny. The Founding Fathers had enough brains for preventing the situation when dictators run the country. They decided that armed nation is able to overthrow a tyrant. Maybe is it a true reason why Hillary Clinton stands against the Second Amendment?"

On October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall, The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else!

Conservative,"A heavily armed Syed Farook, his wife and brother opened fire on a holiday banquet for his co-workers Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously wounding more than a dozen others in a precision assault. Hours later, two terrorists died in a shootout with San Bernardino police. One shooter still at large.        It is known that gunmen are Muslims. They are very religious and probably linked with ISIS. California shooting should become a lesson for the administration — accepting refugees from Syria threatens the National security. It's tragedy. Enemies of America attacked our people again. Unfortunately, today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer terrorism. Nevertheless, we will not allow terrorists to change our way of life. We will not allow them to restrict our freedoms. We express our sincere condolences to families of victims in California shooting.

Conservative,There're a lot of racial discrimination going on in America these days. Can you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government change the law in their favor. Nonsense! The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it's never been more apparent that the U.S. government values white lives above all others. The most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in Philadelphia. #GunmeninOregon #TheMove #1985Bombing

Liberal,"Congressional Republicans voted on Thursday to make it more difficult for refugees from Syria and Iraq to come to the US as the fallout from last Friday's Isis terrorist attacks in Paris continues.   In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too great a risk to national security. New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has said his state will not take in any refugees — ""not even orphans under the age of five"". Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to ""track"" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have played down. GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US government prioritize Christian refugees. Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the anti-refugee comments as ""un-American"", but experts worry the backlash could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked. The stories you need to read, in one handy email Read more ""Sowing fear of refugees is exactly the kind of response groups like Isis are seeking,"" said lain Levine, deputy executive director for program at Human Rights Watch, on Thursday. ""Yes, governments need to bring order to refugee processing and weed out militant extremists, but now more than ever they also need to stand with people uprooted from their homes by ideologies of hatred and help them find real protection."" http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america- fact-from-fiction-congress Obama has condemned more than half of the US's governors as ̀un-American' for saying they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees.

Liberal,"Police Officer Robert Rialmo's attorney, Joel Brodsky, says that he will be filing a counterclaim against the estate of Quintonio LeGrier on the grounds of assault and emotional distress. This is how it looks like when A White Police kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it's his right to sue the dead because sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops, then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn't enough killing a mentally disordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the dead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black."

Closeted minor leaguer for St Louis Cardinals quit after coach and players spoke of killing gay people Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft and given a chance to pursue his dream of being in the big leagues. But after just one season pitching for a Cardinals minor league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during his playing days, he was a closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US. And the hate goes on and on and on .... You need fight back! It's a shame all those ""big strong men"" are afraid of what somebody does in private!!"

Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these children stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers — ages of 5, 9, and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times.

Most people are jailed because one way or the other there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands.

Conservative,"Patricia Smith, a mother of Benghazi arrack victim's made some statements this Thursday broadcast on Fox Business Network. She said there is ""a special place in hell"" for people like Hillary ""and I hope she enjoys it there"".        Smith added in her interview: ""I want Hillary to talk to me personally, and tell me why there was no security there, when they were asked for it. I know this, because I spoke to my son. That day, he says he was really scared, because he saw the 17 people — 17 November, whatever it was, that they were walking around taking pictures. And he was afraid. He says it didn't look very good. And he was afraid. And that he asked for security, and he was turned down."" This must be a mean joke we're having that kind of liar as a possible president. Even understanding that most liberals are brainwashed I just don't get it - how can a politician caught in a lie of that scale still be trusted by electorate? One must be totally insane to follow THAT kind of leader. Patricia's son is an American hero and his blood is on Hillary's hands."
Liberal,"The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK's endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and ""white supremacists"". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared ""I don't know anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking people I know nothing about.""        However, ""for some reasons"" the same mass media in their revelation campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of ""surpassing eloquence and nobility"". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying ""It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd. He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a government that improves the lives of the people it serves."" So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that. Isn't that a little hypocritical?"
Conservative,"The former secretary of state's chain of lies continues and seems like not going to end. This Tuesday Hillary Clinton dared to state we have no immigration crisis and things are just fine with invader policy. ""I think we've done a really good job securing the border,"" she declared.        Well, that's her strategy — keep lying over and over until all her words become true (which is never). Or maybe by ""good job"" she meant Obama's Government provided Hillary's sponsors like Wall-Mart Corporation with low- paid illegal workers? If one day God lets this liar enter the White House as a president — that day would be a real national tragedy."
Conservative,"Hillary Clinton made new promises to extend our traitor President Obama's pro-immigration policy. She also promised to offer illegals residency and ""a path of citizenship"". During the debate on 8th March she was asked about deportation.       Clinton said: ""I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe."" Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind this world ""children"" — young men who claim to be less than 18. Same way the ""illegals without a criminal record"" is also those who are not proved to be criminals yet. Crossing the U.S. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that should bring just one simple punishment — deportation and a prohibition of further entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that. We do not need a president who forgives this kind of crime. We do not need Hillary."
Conservative,"This Monday Clinton had a public interview event where she was asked to tell about Iraq war and Intervention in Libya during her being as a secretary of state. After attacks in Benghazi, after her actions and lies caused a national scandal, after officially being caught on lies she afforded herself to make a statement ""I've said Iraq was a mistake. Libya was a different kind of calculation. And we didn't lose a single person.""        More than three years passed after the accident and still Clinton didn't even contact Benghazi victims' families. She didn't even try to ask for excuse, like those murdered Americans don't even exist. We definitely don't need a President who lies without a twinge of conscience. Luckily most Americans won't trust such an obvious liar."

Conservative,"Religious leaders joined local organizations in rallying support for two men who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St. That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus. One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous. They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money. When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this country,"" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?"" The incident ""escalated really quick,"" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down. He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" and screaming, ""We'll make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!"""

Liberal,"An Open Letter to Hillary Clinton: Dear Mrs. Clinton, We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our voices be heard. We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential campaign, but did you support us before campaign? We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI- Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry, but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United States.

Liberal,"It was a powerful moment in an America that has seen hate crimes against Muslim Americans triple since November. In an America where the Republican political party had a 44% very unfavorable view of Islam, despite 78% of the same Republican respondents saying they neither worked with nor had any Muslim friends. according to a YouGov poll conducted from 6 -9 March, 2015. In an America where failed businessman and top contender for the GOP nomination Donald Trump has publicly and unapologetically called for widespread surveillance on mosques, mass deportations, denial of asylum to all Muslims and has lauded a plan to shoot Muslims with bullets covered in pigs blood. So when Bernie Sanders acts like a human being and commits his prospective presidency (not to mention entire career) to combatting racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Muslim Americans overwhelmingly support his bid for the White House."

Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed.

Liberal,"The statistics show that nationwide 15 percent of Black students receive suspensions, comparing with 4 percent of white students. In some state, the numbers are even more disturbing. For example, Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3 percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be suspended from school. The racism in education is the reason why the school-to-prison pipeline exists.        Our kids cannot even get a proper education, no wonder the success rate among black students is low. Somehow white people still think that education is only their privilege."

Conservative,"The recent poll has shown military representatives prefer Trump two times more than Clinton. I wonder how Hillary can even have military supporters, our soldiers have suffered enough from the liberal-in-chief for the last eight years. What's also confusing in that poll — almost every fifth polled soldier refuses to vote at all. It's a great demonstration out troops no longer trust the President, and Clinton would definitely not change the situation. No need to remind you what mistakes can Hillary do if allowed running our military forces —we don't need another Iraq and we definitely don't need another Benghazi."
Conservative,"Remember that terrible case when a student was forced by York Comprehensive High School officials to remove the Old Glory from his pickup? It happened in May 2015 and luckily had a happy end, as a result the students were allowed to attach our flag to their vehicles.       The story ended well by efforts of dozens of patriots united to protest against High School authorities. It was a peaceful but strong and confident protest that made the authorities listen, it was a great example of how conscious people should act. We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks on American values and Constitutional laws. Unfortunately our current Government approves and even provokes these attacks, and the liberals' offensive and violent moods make it clear — every American patriot has to be careful and attentive."

Of course, the highest incarceration level is among the black population of the country. The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the whole community. Kids have to grow up not knowing their fathers and not having the support they need to make rights choices and school-to-prison pipeline doesn't leave them much of a choice. The kids grow up in extreme poverty without the access to the basic things like healthcare or education. The system is build to keep as many black people in the jails as possible.

Detective Lancaster was a U.S Air Force veteran and had served with the Kansas City Police Department for 10 years. Honor to our hero; may his soul Rest in Peace. It is our duty to remember the heroes who left this world protecting us. We must resist the liberal propaganda accusing our cops in all deadly sins and we must keep on repeating our policemen are real heroes. It is important to rely on our police especially on the back of recent rising wave of liberal violent protests — our cops become the only guardians to protect us against rage and violence of hateful crowds.
Conservative,"Every American's right to bear arms is absolutely sacred, period. All the liberal attacks on it are very worrying because the Amendment was not only made for self defense — it is a nation's ability to overthrow the tyranny. A Government that doesn't trust its citizens to possess weapons can never receive mutual trust or respect. And that's what things are now — there's a great mistrust between the people and the country Administration and the only way for our ""leaders"" to establish relations with Americans is to stop all attacks on the Second Amendment."

According to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average annual SSA retirement benefit for legal citizens is roughly $14,772. As if that weren't enough, the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for refugees. This just says it all.

Conservative,"BLACK STATE TROOPER WHO WON LAWSUIT AGAINST POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION FACED THE SAME ISSUED WHEN HE RETURNED TO WORK Two Michigan Black police troopers who recently won lawsuit in racial discrimination and were awarded $5.2 million are suing police department again, claiming they faced the same issues. According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever since they returned to work; they have been subjected to petty attacks and denied attempts in promotion. Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper Hall received a ""need improvement rating,"" his squad car was taken away, and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall,. police trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended on the basis of race. Once again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately; black police officers still remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police department despite the fact that we live in a ""post-racial' society."

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses; he was so mad about the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building. Abdulwalia's anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was trying to send: having a black president changes almost nothing."

For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation proceeds. Nothing will bring the victims of Charleston massacre back, but this money will help aid in bridging the gap in the loss of an income.

Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when Morsi- Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too. The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held personally and financially responsible for their actions.

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them. FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the officers involved in Bethea's death. There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20 minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in prison for murder. America, it's not a black or white problem... but a blue one."
Conservative,"SHOCKING!!! Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking. Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless.        The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125. The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon. To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive. For more stories, join our new brand site http://donotshoot.us/"

Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

I didn't notice in the video the suspect spitting at Dickson. However; the police department didn't consider it necessary to punish the cop. The only penalty he got was a suspension without pay for 1 day. Is it really enough for excessive force use?"

They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it. In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you, they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job. Bad that America trained not like this!???"

Conservative,"All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secret gay club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even if it's evident. There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly enough, ""Sworn officer of the court"" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

The words will be replaced with ""Asian Americans"" and ""African Americans,"" respectively. ""The term ̀ Oriental' has no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be gone for good,"" Meng said in a statement on Friday.

The lawsuit filed Friday says House Bill 1523 violates the separation of church and state by favoring ""certain narrow religious beliefs that condemn same-sex couples who get married, condemn unmarried people who have sexual relations and condemn transgender people."" How many times do we have to do this? Your BELIEFS don't supersede my RIGHTS!!

(Qur'an 4:89)        This Surah is an evidence of how Syrian refugees respect our culture. If you think that Muslims ignore some Islamic rules, you're wrong. For example, a Muslim in eastern Uganda strangled his Christian wife to death this month for leaving Islam. What would you do if your wife or husband converts to Islam? Probably you would be upset. In the worst case, you would sue for divorce. But I'm sure you would not kill your spouse. That's the difference between our cultures."

Liberal,"Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs!        A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen."

Liberal,"Please take a moment to read my story! Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys? Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why..."

In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below."

Cooke didn't commit any crime, that's why she wanted to leave, but officers had the different plans. She was thrown to the ground by the male agent and the female agent deployed the taser. After she screamed from the pain for several seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck and searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in handcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg before she could go home.

In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed. He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War. Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was accused of committing a felony.

All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen."

Liberal,"Please take a moment to read my story! Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys? Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why..."
Conservative,"Cops are allergic to cameras, they don't like being recorded because it won't allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented them the opportunity to break the law.        ?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below."

I didn't notice in the video the suspect spitting at Dickson. However; the police department didn't consider it necessary to punish the cop. The only penalty he got was a suspension without pay for 1 day. Is it really enough for excessive force use?"

Since July 7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there. Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it.

Liberal,"HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are some real Clinton decisions: —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits."" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!"

Liberal,"Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William Evans. A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33, of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October 12. He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire themselves. This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the President of the United States. Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country. Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse racism, against those who want to destroy America! Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists."

Unfortunately, the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party ""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"".

The man was arrested right in the Capitol and charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief. It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale. Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda influences even on Southern people.

And here are some real Clinton decisions: —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits."" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!"

Conservative,"Fellow Texans! It's time to say a strong NO to the establishment robbers. It is  unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For  centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but  they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does  not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it  mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some  outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a  victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.  We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on  the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and  gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but  not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher  taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist  attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them  what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

Liberal,"CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year- old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay."

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, ""It's Up to Us,"" she was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because ignoring it can take away years of people's lives. Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half of people shot by cops are mentally ill?

Conservative,"Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off- duty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year- old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. ""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley. Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed. #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice"

He added that the man ""wasn't resisting at all until they tased him"" After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay on the ground, screaming for help.

Conservative,"Prior to cooking delicious five-star cuisine, celebrity chef Jeff Henderson cooked something else entirely dangerous—cocaine. As a teenager, Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles. By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for cooking, while he was on kitchen duty. He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can achieve in life with the right choices."

When cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face. The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame. This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions.

Liberal,"The US-led coalition strike in Syria's Raqqa province killed 12 women, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning. The second coalition strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%. However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008."

Liberal,"Mexicans are known for their masculinity and militancy, as many wars in the past say. That's why the US often offers Mexicans to join the armed forces, in exchange for what they promise to give American citizenship. In this regard, Mexicans are often sent to the war zone in Syria or other countries, from where they sometimes do not return. Many Mexicans have to go for it, as today the process of obtaining American citizenship can last for years and even dozens of years. The US policy towards Mexicans is becoming increasingly brutal, therefore, it is necessary to stop any attempts by the US government to send Mexicans to the war zones, where they fight for any unknown goals."
Liberal,"The Senate of the U.S. Congress approved a bill that seriously broadens the scope of combat operations of the U.S. Armed Forces. According to this bill, the U.S. will send far more soldiers to Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and similar countries. Since thousands of Mexican have served in the U.S. Army, this law should never be implemented. Mexican soldiers shouldn't die in vain for the sake of foreign political ambitions."

On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see the police lights because the unit was parked down the road. Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection. When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend off the would-be burglars. However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

Liberal,"It's just ridiculous that we lack money for veterans' healthcare and housing, lack recourses to enforce our border security, but at the same time have enough budget funds to continue this devastating policy of bombing foreign countries. Ordinary Americans get zero profit from oil wars that last for years but don't end. Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, we've been involved in conflicts in these countries for years, and none of these conflicts gave us anything but growing state debt."
Conservative,"I believe Ron Paul's position on our foreign military policy is absolutely right. After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end Obama's policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas. ""We're not going into Syria"", Trump said it to calm down those who got really concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war. Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria) puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will succeed any better than it did the last time."" Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We've started the whole Afghanistan thing to beat the Soviets, and no there's no Soviet Union on the world map, and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian students."
Liberal,"The Obama Administration turned a great idea of fighting terrorism into drawing our country into another regime change venture. Our military presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly opposite to the ""America First"" concept. I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it, but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential campaign Trump said ""let's bring back our soldiers home"", and now it's really time to do it. This is not our war."
Liberal,"Middle East wars are one of the reasons why we are in $20 trillion debt today. We could have solved thousands of economic and security problems by simply rejecting the aggressive military policy we've been having for so long. Iraq war didn't end terrorism, and didn't solve the Islamization problem. If we repeat the same war in Syria, we'll only get the same result: no profit for American citizens and several thousands of dead American soldiers. Globalists, terrorists and Corporations are the only ones who benefit from oil wars."
Conservative,"Our politicians should never forget that. We've been watching our military commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let's hope it will end now when Trump is in charge. A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa. We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all. Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly another oil war. We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition, the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone. There's only one chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe."

For all the families who were forced out of their homes, for the mothers who had to watch their sons and daughters suffering, for the children who are now orphans because of this terrible wicked war. Words can't heal their pain; our tears won't bring back those who left us already; nothing can console our grief right now. However, we have the duty to save those whose lives are still at risk. For the sake of these people, we have to work to end this terrible war. Unfortunately, we haven't seen much development in this direction. Bombing random targets and going for momentary aims, taking reckless decisions and shifting our focus off crushing terrorists only leads to more casualties among civilians and creates even more suffering. We have to stick to our agenda and work to protect people, launching additional missiles on them won't help. Pray for peace to return to Syria and work sanely to bring this moment closer!"

Conservative,"Those duplicitous politicians say they want to end the war in Syria though all they do makes the situation worse and leads to more blood spilled in the Middle East. Unfortunately, many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the American establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to civilian casualties. It is them who keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other groups. These people want more American involvement because it means more money for them and they don't care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the corrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote anti-terrorist agenda! Focus on what's truly important and we will end the war in Syria sooner than you can imagine."

Liberal,"Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs!        A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen."
Conservative,"Cops are allergic to cameras, they don't like being recorded because it won't allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented them the opportunity to break the law.        ?WARNING!!!?

According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below."

Liberal,"New administration's budget proposal to Congress includes $1.7 trillion in mandatory spending cuts over 10 years, including $800 billion from Medicaid and $193 billion from food stamps. At the same time, this proposal, called ""A New Foundation for American Greatness"", includes a boost in military spending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico. To be honest, I'm not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our focus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get more money for their wars, and they don't mind it if average Americans live in poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our Department of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the next eight countries combined, isn't it enough? Here is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Based on what we know about this budget, the good news -- the only good news -- is that it's likely to be roundly rejected by members of both parties here in the Senate — just as the last budget was"""
Liberal,"The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for 2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31 % cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high- powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria. Start thinking!"

He said that sending troops to Syria was a very difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama was hated for not taking actions, but it's better for being hated for not killing innocent people that for starting a useless war. Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed. Unfortunately, the recent government didn't think twice, before they started bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill innocent kids in Syria.

Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014. The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide. Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have different hair texture."

Liberal,"Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company. One of co-founders said ""We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support."" Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history, something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of the shop: the drum is for ""communications within the diaspora,"" and the spear symbolizes ""whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the people."" The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores. Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital issues. Let's not forget our legacy!

Liberal,"""First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois"" It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap"

Conservative,"An immigration judge has ordered an Army veteran from Chicago, who served two tours of duty, to be deported. His name is Miguel Perez and he is Chicano in every sense of the word. Perez moved to Chicago when he was 8-years- old and was a permanent legal resident. He joined the U.S. Army and served two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an explosion. Perez served seven years; but because he is not a U.S. citizen, Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and began the deportation process. This system doesn't appreciate our sacrifices. America was designed that way it will only benefit gringos. Miguel Perez is a real hero, who was betrayed by America.

People should know the origins, not to confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird. White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.

In 1947, she became the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in Chemistry when she graduated from Columbia University. Today, inspiring many young Black girls to become chemists, Dr. Daly researched the connection between high cholesterol and heart disease. Black excellence has a rich and powerful history. #blackexcellence #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #African Empowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticallyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOfSelflsANationality #EconomicEmpowerment #Integration Failed #WhiteLiesMatter #Education #African U n ifi cation #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #JusticeOrElse #ProBlack #Regrann #blackexcellence"
Conservative,"Whoever doubted her should start to believe that determination based on the truth of one's ""self' is the key to success. Yes she still looks hot and cute and sexy and much more beautiful than a million women of all races who put on so many make-up, tarnishing the original melanin strength. No one is saying make-ups are bad. Just saying that natural Melanin is more powerful than any other make-up product! #blackexcellence #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #African Empowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticallyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOfSelflsANationality #EconomicEmpowerment #Integration Failed #WhiteLiesMatter #Education #African Unification #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #JusticeOrElse #ProBlack #Regrann #blackexcellence"

Liberal,"ATTENTION! COMMUNITY CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT!       Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman! This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the woman tell Lim, ""Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything."" And why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what? Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black people were treated disrespectfully! We don't believe apologies, especially when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose! Williams&Kalvin www.youtube.com"

Conservative,"Today Americans are able to elect a president with godly moral principles. Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is. And even though Donald Trump isn't a saint by any means, he's at least an honest man and he cares deeply for this country. My vote goes for him!  https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2FI.facebook.com%2 Flsr. php%3Fu%3D"
