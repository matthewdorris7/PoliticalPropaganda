LGBT United,"NOT EVERY BOY WANTS TO BE A SOLDIER. A beautiful message was seen on the streets of the capitol,. with no group name or credits attached to the project. It was the poster at top, of the bearded man in a pink gown behaving like a queen and holding a sign saying ""Not every boy wants to be a soldier"". A timely message for today. The two recent U.S. wars were costly for our nation; to put it lightly. They led to domestic devastation of country. No matter what Defense Secretary or POTUS are saying they don't fool me with promises of gay military equality as key to the nation's agenda. Better talk to me about cutting DoD's budget. FOLKS. #Igbt #USarmy #CrossDress #GaySoldier #Obama #DefenseBudget #StopWar"

Black Matters,"American Racists On The Road        The racists group of America ""Back To The Blue"" are organizing a hate rally in response to the public outcry and protests against police officers. ""Bikers-patriots"" want to descend on the McKinney Police HQ in a show of solidarity for the police because race-baiters and cop-haters. They plan to have ""the biggest thing to happen in Patriot Movement since the Bundy Ranch victory!"" It seems like we won't get into ""post-racial America"".... this event and the regular murder of innocent Black children by white supremacist police and citizens makes that clear. The modern government has brought racist America to the forefront, good or bad. This is something that America has a serious issue with - RACISM! Is it time to call out the national guard?"
Black Matters,"Today we celebrate the legendary rapper who ever lived: Happy B-day, Tupac! The greatest of all time rapper is known not only for his music but for the wise words he spoke and his strength in standing up against oppression. His real name was Lesane Parish Crooks. Shakur was only 25 years old at the time he was shot and killed in 1996. His killer has never been caught. We will never forget 2Pac. Today we remember him on what would've been his 44th Birthday."
Black Matters,Americans so much effort to hate each other instead of putting the effort into doing something useful. Stop racism! We all belong to ONE HUMAN RACE.
Black Matters,"No national outrage for an incident at pool party where a black teen was shot to death        Today, the pool party in Georgia is even more shocking than a recent pool party in Texas. A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager's pool party which ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager Clanton passed away on the way to hospital. In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident. Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black teenager dies? Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the shootings at the average pool party."
Black Matters,"A 13-year-old child was tasered by cop for skateboarding        A San Diego sheriff's deputy was filmed tasering 13-year-old child in the spine for skateboarding. Witnesses reported that the cop tried to force them to delete videos from their phones. Videos show how the child writhes in agony from being tased. Police said that the child ran away from home and was missing for a day-and-half. However it doesn't give the reason to taser a child. We see another case of police misconduct, when the policeman actually attacked the child. This case should reach the court, because the child hasn't done anything unlawful. The policeman exceeded his powers and used force against a child. So he should be punished. Before the trial nothing's gonna change and cops are about to do whatever they want. The task of all Americans who have witnessed police brutality is to extend all the information about it in order to reach out the government and the court."
Black Matters,"Only 9 days this year nobody was killed by police        According to data from Mapping Police Violence there are only 9 days this calendar year when nobody was killed by police in the USA. Since January 1, 2015 at least 508 people have now been killed by policemen. Moreover, analyzing all deaths caused by police, African-American and Hispanic people are more likely to be killed than Whites. Figures show that the index of deaths for black people is 3.45 per million, while for whites it is 1.26 per million. Add here military-style equipment and non-lethal weapons, given to cops. And only 0.02 per cent of the nation's police forces are investigated each year. Only 0.02! That means, US policemen are immune from criminal changes in their killings. That's why they carry out their daily police raids to destroy the population at the territories under their control."
Black Matters,"Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone *CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE* A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore? #CharlestonShooting #chsnews"
Black Matters,"Rachel Dolezal is wearing the other persons shoes. Rachel Dolezal drew attention to her racial identification. A white-born former NAACP leader claimed to be black. The criticism towards Dolezal stems controversy around her identity and her position as the president of the NAACP in Washington. Today. Dolezal sees herself as first transracial. Rachel Dolezal stated that her racial identity was black, American Indian; white and two more races. Moreover if she proves that she is black; than anyone else will be able to prove that he/she is not even a human being. What do you think about her? What kind of rights should she have?"
Black Matters,"The violent pool story #3. White police officer slammed black teen against his        car This black family from Ohio will never forget the June 9th. According to the family's testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight children, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield. Nevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of the children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon walked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an ID-card. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed Dixon's family and grabbed 12-year-old child by neck. But according to the Fairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive force. Did the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race factor? Don't you think the police officer's attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was unlawful? How the police officers should be charged? What kind of right of defense do you have against unlawful arrests? These days, there is far more to being a ""good cop"" than choosing not to hurt innocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even today, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America transmitted through music, lyrics, titles, literature, movies and folk saying. White Americans across the country embrace African-Americans the image of criminals and looters. How are we going to live with that?"

Black Matters,"Thousands Walk Hand In Hand Across Ravenel Bridge To Show Support For Mother Emanuel Church On Sunday evening, hours after Emanuel A.M.E. Church opened its doors for the first service following the killing of nine of its congregants Wednesday, thousands in Charleston took to the streets in a show of support and solidarity. Observers on the bridge, and thousands more at the base, joined hands to create a ""unity chain,"" then held a moment of silence that lasted five minutes in honor of the fallen. Police estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 took part in Sunday's gathering, according to the Post and Courier. Cars drove slowly past the bridge, taking in the sight and honking horns in solidarity as people chanted ""Charleston strong!"" Throughout history people start to unite only when they face danger or when they're in times of great sorrow. Modern America is accustomed to meet only imaginary dangers, however, Americans are getting more and more reasons to sorrow over something day by day. Does it mean that the key to the unity of 330 million Americans is constant fear and unending sorrow? Does it mean that only this can make Americans unite and forget about the infighting and differences? Unfortunately, yes, it does."

Black Matters,"How many of you believe in Black Jesus?        There is quite a big number of people arguing about ethnicity of Jesus Christ. Was Jesus white, olive-skinned or black? The Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt owns the earliest painting of Jesus Christ in the Church of Rome (6th century) where skin color of Jesus was black."
Black Matters,Black is beautiful. God knows what he is doing. The Black skin is a glorious symbol of national greatness.
Black Matters,"A small group of activists burned two confederate flags in response to shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.        Why the symbol of the pro-slavery rebellion is still flying on the ground of South Carolina? Why the symbol of white supremacy is still flying on the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia? Why the flag that represents the murder of blacks was not removed from the national statehouse? The confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery time, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations. We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to Andrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned slaves on their farms. How can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show ourselves to be men the same as any other race of men?"

Black Matters,"Cornel West on Obama: ""The First Black President Has Become The First Niggerized Black President""        Reacting to President Obama's use of the n-word on Marc Maron's podcast, Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy."" ""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said we have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America but white supremacy is American as cherry pie."" West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and 2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The number is horrific."
Black Matters,"Autopsy Says Freddie Gray Died After Sustaining 'High-Energy Injury' in Police Van        The Baltimore state medical examiner's office has found that Freddie Gray likely died from a single ""high-energy injury"" sustained as he rode shackled in the back of a police van on the day of his arrest, according to an autopsy report obtained by the Baltimore Sun. The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so. It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something? Cops imprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you to war, keep you poor, call you a thug and get away with it. There's no excuse for what happened to Freddie."
Black Matters,"Ella Baker. The woman behind the scenes. Not many of you will probably be able to recognize Ella Baker, who was a hero of the civil rights Freedom Movement, racial and economic injustice for five decades. Her job was to put together the pieces in order to create a strong organization in the face of racism and injustice. She played a key role in NAACP; Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference."

Black Matters,"Philosophy of African-American activist Huey Newton        Huey Newton was an African-American political activist and a leader of generation of black, best known for founding the militant Black Panther Party in 1966. As a child, Newton experienced racial discrimination that influenced him to create the Black Panther Party as a voice of black people. His party grew up to a size of 5,000 full time party workers in 45 branches across America and inspired generation in North America to join the struggle against oppression. But he was shot to death in August 1989."
Black Matters,"More riots are coming this summer ... unless What is the most important thing the government must to do this year in order our country to live in peace? The criminal justice system is very important institution where law enforcement investigate a crime gathering evidences to identify the presumed perpetrator ensuring that rights of the convicted are respected. But what if American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a renewed sense of justice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main challenge of the criminal justice system? Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of America. Consequently, the victim's skin color plays a crucial role in deciding what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots, then they must think about the living standards of black population that is several times below the living standards of white people in America. In addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black population by revising the hiring policy for black Americans. Therefore, if we want a life's balance, the government have to reconsider all these things, because Black Americans lives matter."
Black Matters,"Fifty years ago, 48% of African American adults and 57% of African American children lived in poverty. Today, only 28% of African American adults and 38% of African American children live in poverty. We've come so far, but still there is a long way to go."

LGBT United,"NOM'S LAST ATTEMPT TO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets.       That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states — so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it! There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they worked for made anyone's life better. At all. They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable. And when they're dead and gone, they'll be remembered only as footnotes in shameful history — or more likely they'll be forgotten completely. #LGBT #NOM #SameSexMarriage #Marriage #SCOTUS #equality"

But now that she's a star in 'Orange is the New Black', the popularity of this model, actress, and VJ has grown worldwide.        ""Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender,"" - Rose said; - ""I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born one. As a little kid, I was convinced that I was a guy. Then in my teens, I tried to be quite feminine ... And after a little bit, chopped everything off and am kind of back where I started. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes."" #Igbt #RubyRose #GenderFluidity #lesbian #OrangelsTheNewBlack"

LGBT United,"The ninth transgender was found death in the USA Transgender teen Mercedes Williamson was found dead in a wooded area. She is the ninth confirmed transgender homicide victim in the USA this year. Police in George County. Mississippi have charged a suspect Josh Brandon Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was transgender. Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in 1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call `freedom'? America is no longer land of freedom!"

'I spent the majority of my life lying, hiding and depressed because I felt like I couldn't truly be who I wanted to be and live freely as I saw fit. I had to act and that's not me. I, nor anyone else, should have to do that.' Matt decided to tell the truth publicly because of speculation that was going behind his back.

There are at least twenty eight percent of LGBT students in Asawa High School. It is the fact that we need such classes in every American school! Children shouldn't be afraid to show who they are; they shouldn't be afraid to speak about LGBT history; they should know that it is normal to be gay or lesbian or transgender.

The Sodomite Suppression Act proposes that ""any person who willingly touches another person of the same gender for purposes of sexual gratification be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method."" The act also will outlaw advocating gay rights to minors. California Attorney General Kamala Harris claimed that the proposal was unconstitutional and it had no place in civil society. The proposal reminds me the Inquisition. We live in a free and tolerate country! So even talks about such an initiative should be immediately stopped. Where is our President? Stop considering gays as naughty and not like all the others. We are all equal. Despite all the arguments that the opponents of gay marriage call, polls show that the majority of Americans stand for gay marriages. Why not to hold a referendum as the Irish did? Why we should listen to conservatives?"

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders  without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting's longstanding  policy of chartered organizations selecting their leaders.  The Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay adults has stood as a towering  example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America's most  important and recognizable civic organizations.  This is a step in the right direction, but we're still really concerned that there  are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay leaders ...

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary among his fellow Army soldiers. But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army. He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee, he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska. Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded! America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity. Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war. #Igbt #transgender #equality #usarmy #Ortega"

After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious  education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she  just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's  been married for all eight years.  Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing  their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is  the biggest mistake!  When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about  homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about  being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and  harassment.  Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for  straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and  people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's  important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be  illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual  or perceived sexual orientation!"

Black Matters,"Man Dies After Police Use Pepper Spray During Arrest In Alabama        A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday. Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat. The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation. This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever, but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable?

I can't breathe."" On Wednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall, Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a flashlight before killing him in view of his family members. Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a flashlight, Sander's attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate. Parrish later clarified that those allegations came from family members who witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced ""some kind of asphyxiation"" during the altercation. Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two children. The last words of Eric garner were ""I can't breathe,"" the last words of Jonathan Sanders were ""I can't breathe, let me go"".

Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that he experienced in school and on the streets. People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her children would get arrested. What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police, improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer. That's why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed people of color killed by police. How dangerous is to live in your area today?"

""Black features are beautiful, black women are not,"" Stenberg wrote. ""White women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty standards."" Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer. In modern America black women experience more depression than probably during slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden behind the mask of tolerance."

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank Garmback, to face charges in the shooting. Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun. Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots pellets, died the next day. By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...

Not seven years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death. This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 p.m. Saturday in a housing complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen pistol. His mother said that she respected the police and that her son ""shouldn't have had the gun."" But from what witnesses have told her, she said, ""They didn't have to shoot him down like that."" One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at anyone as he tried to run from officers. When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye.

In the process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling $73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher. Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely disgracefully?

Black Matters,"Made In The US: The Justice Turns Into Business For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor charges in New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'cause they couldn't afford to pay bail. Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail! Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other Presidents administrations were brought to justice.

Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida (21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421). Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened.

Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture.

We don't want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam, according to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live comfortable together. And on the other hand, Muslims won't tend to radical activities and the destruction of peaceful life of Americans."

Being Patriotic,"The spread of hatred in the American society        On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina's statehouse. Some of them present the KKK's rally against the removal of the Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag. It is a very clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races. The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we should clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn't refuse our history and our traditions."
Being Patriotic,"The U.S. flag hasn't been lowered in honor of the murdered Marines        Monday morning, July 20, the US flag continued to fly at the top of the White House and the US capitol building despite the fact that a gunman killed five US Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn. President Obama hasn't ordered to lower a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon, the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service members murdered in Tennessee. By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then decided to kill in the name of Allah. In general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do not even bother to learn English, because it's enough to speak Spanish, has increased."

LGBTQ youth actively plan suicide at a 2.6 times greater rate than straight youth. LGBTQ youth attempt suicide at a 4.0 times greater rate than straight youth. LGBTQ youth require medical attention for suicide attempts at a 5.1 times greater rate than straight youth. Behind these numbers are countless lives lost. This has to stop!

Especially when you think about how much money is to be gained if same-sex couples are legally allowed to get married. A majority of small business owners believe companies shouldn't be allowed to withhold goods or services from lesbian, gay,bisexual or transgender people based on an owner's religious beliefs, according to a survey released Monday. Of course marriage is good for the business - no matter who it is that is marrying. It's a billion dollar industry in our country! I am certain that if a state supported marriage for all, then business would flourish. No one would be offended by not being considered legitimate, when their feelings are legitimate."

He has been discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.        There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth. Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth. Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against injustice and inequality! #Kentucky #transgender #inequality #discrimination"

The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo. with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don't you think? What's this; the American version of Je suis Charlie? Joe Rosenthal's picture of soldiers hauling a flag pole up after declaring the island of Iwo Jima secure during the Second World War won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945.

Mike Lee has been anti-LGBT conservatives' top priority since the Supreme Court brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It's part of the National Organization for Marriage's post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily. Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does is enable anti-gay discrimination. Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against religious institutions —for discriminating against people in same-sex marriages. It's the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them. Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that we have full Federal civil rights now. Or don't!

Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to serve a same-sex couple. In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new claim about how these bakers' ""free speech"" is under attack and how they're thus the real victims. There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do business with the public!

The popular show is based on a young boy named Steven, who grows up with three magical aliens — the 'Crystal Gems' Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl. The show, which has already won praise for including a number of strong, female characters in a comparatively male-dominated genre, has now hinted at further diversity. That's s000 nice!

Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians, especially those who support marriage equality. I believe religions should teach love, they must stop teaching hatred! And noticed while progressive Christians are constantly under attack from conservative Christians, they're not the ones screaming ""persecution"". They are just tired of the persecution."

Being Patriotic,"Controversy surrounding the flag only heats animosity among Americans. And it is becoming dangerous.        So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family. ""He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,"" Mark Wilson said. When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a flag of England or France. Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political correctness because George Washington owned slaves. Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to eliminate the party.

LGBT United,"Most parents aren't prepared for the words, ""Mom, Dad. I'm gay."" For many  parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The  answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help  to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your  continued relationship with your son or daughter.  Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their  child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as  problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during  that time.  Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're  hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you  choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the  impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want  for dinner?"").  Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If  you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you  would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept  secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.  It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because  homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment  for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of  telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".  On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding  and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is  she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!  DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!  #children #lgbt #momdadimgay #gayisok #comingout #acceptance"

Due to her bad health history she was taken to the hospital and released. But she died in jail waiting for someone to help.

Being one of the 17 children of former slaves she was the first and the only child to go to African-American school. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls because she believed that education was the key to racial advancement.

Chief Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell's dismissal he filed a complaint on unequal employment opportunities claiming he was paid less than his white predecessors. This is circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts based on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are treated unfairly.

However, there is more work to be done to solve racial tensions in America. The public stand against discrimination happens when there is lack of inside connections with the government. People attempt to stop racism the government usually assumes to be problematic but protesters force the government to find compromise. It's a well known fact, when governments do not deliver, people protest."

And now there are three main points that you should think of: 1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo State University. Never was involved in criminal activities. 2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and was working under the supervision of a training officer. 3) Taylor didn't want to die young. Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want our kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes doomed to disappointment?"

Yesterday night. a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day. According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 p.m. in the area of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard. Oakland police officers spotted a vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital. Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?

What should they do if they get pulled over? What if they do something they don't supposed to be doing? It is not always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it's a reality. What if police officers will automatically assume that your child is criminal because of how him or her looks. Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the way they look. That's why it's important to instruct our children how to react when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows your child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store. Remember, anything is better than dying. Anyways, it's hard to believe that in 21 st century black parents have to teach their children both survive and thrive. But who will take responsibility for training police officers?"

According to St. Louis Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the suspect four times were about seven years on the force. That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later on, nine people were arrested on charges of resisting arrest. The protesters said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it?

Black Americans often complaint about being pulled over for the phenomenon called ""driving while black"". For example, a rich African American driving new Ferrari can be stopped hundreds of times for no apparent reason just because the fact that a black man driving an expensive car attract the attention of the police officers. But what if racial profiling ends with lethal consequences? Do you remember Sandra Bland who had run-ins with the police while driving? Do you all remember that she was found dead in police custody? Do we all have to avoid traffic stops in order to survive? For the matter of fact, the routine traffic stops are being a big deal for the people of color. According to the Justice Department statistics, black drivers are about 31 percent more likely to be subject to police than whites. Overall, this number indicates the racial difference in America."

You never know if a simple traffic stop will end up with you in a police custody or bullets in your chest. Unfortunately, many of Americans feel very uncomfortable talking about these issues, which seem to confirm the idea that the government remain silent. Nevertheless, one should accept that African-Americans are more likely to be targeted by police officers on the street than whites. Therefore it endangers the rights of black community.

A copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May. Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June. We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties. First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the final nail in the coffin of the American secret services. Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept safe."

We will carry it with us everywhere and forever. We don't care if the government doesn't want to accept the fact that we are stronger than we were before. We don't care if the government doesn't see our problems. We can build our history on our own; because we are stronger by nature.
Black Matters,"Know your rights and your freedom        The murders of Michael Brown, Tryvon Martin, Freddie Gray, Eric Gartner and other black victims have dramatized depth of racism in America society. They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression. Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is challenging, but it's worth discrimination and unfairness black civilians face everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon you have against police abuse and brutality. The most famous civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of African- Americans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa Parks changed our lives forever. But what changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater equality? What are you doing to fight against injustice and racism? Have you ever protested in civil rights protests or have you ever been part of Black Lives Matter movement? How do your protect your right to free expression? Please comment below, what have YOU done to prove- BLACK LIVES MATTER?"
Being Patriotic,"Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41 percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory.        Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long- term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions."
Being Patriotic,"The 2nd amendment is an integral the Bill of Rights integrated to the U.S. Constitution in 1791. And we know why every Americans have the right to bear arms. First, the 2nd amendment makes people less prone to crimes. Most of people will not attack others, if they have a chance to be shot. Moreover, armed citizens help to prevent some crimes. Second, the 2nd amendment gives equal odds for criminals and people who have no negative intentions. They both have firearms. Third, gun owners as usual feel a responsibility, it makes them law-abiding citizens. Of course, every rule has an exception. However, you see, the 2nd amendment has enormous advantages."
Being Patriotic,"The U.S. Constitutional Convention signed and adopted the Constitution at Philadelphia's Independence Hall 228 years ago. Since then the U.S. Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times. All of amendments are steps that made the United States the greatest country in the world.        The U.S. Constitution is not only the law, it is the basis of the country. Every true patriot respects it. Unfortunately, last decade has become the time of nihilism. More and more people don't respect American law. More and more people come to the United States and some of them don't feel reverence for our Constitution. It goes without saying that illegals who already broke the immigration law and will violate the supreme law easily. But the worst thing is that the current president of the United States and some high-ranking officials also spit upon the Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I think this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has banned all flags and banners, including the U.S. flag -- and so on. The same regards the Iran deal. America has a hard time. And we have to save the U.S. Constitution. We have to do it in God's name! America has to be great again because we are one nation under God!"
Being Patriotic,"On Tuesday, the police said about the shots fired at police officers in Denver and Aurora, Colorado. What is wrong with people? The police officers protect people. But the gang of anarchist thugs declared war against the police. I can't belive it's possible.        The police administer the law. Law-abidingness is an important part of American life. Of course, history knows police mistakes, but a mistaken arrest is very rare occurance. At the same time, don't forget that officers risk their lives every day. Americans have to honor sacrifices of policemen. Police officers significantly improve the quality of life for the citizens of their communities by keeping the peace despite sometimes overwhelming odds. America has to stand against radical activists who threaten not only officers lives, but also our security."

Today we should honor the memory of the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11? I'd like to tell you #My911 Story. I was only 15 when the attacks occurred. I was at school. I remember that somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC. We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took responsibility for the attacks. And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11? #My911 Story"
LGBT United,"Vatican Says Transgender Man Cannot Become A Godparent        The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying out the task. Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender identity. Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery. Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote to the Vatican for advice. Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish. It said transsexual behavior ""reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality."" The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time, the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just another superstition of Church. Funny."

Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker's Rebellion, is the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to chat him up. Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: ""I don't think his sexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it's part of who he is. Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the creators of the new ""Star Wars"" for the incredible courage and opposition to conservative bias in Hollywood cinema. There should be a special organization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors.

I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken Windows."" This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country. Like and share if you want to help the movement!"
Black Matters,"Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead        Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition. One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34, and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help. It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh, wait.

Black Matters,We finally made it! Welcome to the official Black Matters Website! http://blackmattersus.com/
Being Patriotic,"Patricia Smith, a mother of Benghazi arrack victim's made some statements this Thursday broadcast on Fox Business Network. She said there is ""a special place in hell"" for people like Hillary ""and I hope she enjoys it there"".        Smith added in her interview: ""I want Hillary to talk to me personally, and tell me why there was no security there, when they were asked for it. I know this, because I spoke to my son. That day, he says he was really scared, because he saw the 17 people — 17 November, whatever it was, that they were walking around taking pictures. And he was afraid. He says it didn't look very good. And he was afraid. And that he asked for security, and he was turned down."" This must be a mean joke we're having that kind of liar as a possible president. Even understanding that most liberals are brainwashed I just don't get it - how can a politician caught in a lie of that scale still be trusted by electorate? One must be totally insane to follow THAT kind of leader. Patricia's son is an American hero and his blood is on Hillary's hands."
Being Patriotic,"The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK's endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and ""white supremacists"". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared ""I don't know anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking people I know nothing about.""        However, ""for some reasons"" the same mass media in their revelation campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of ""surpassing eloquence and nobility"". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying ""It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd. He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a government that improves the lives of the people it serves."" So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that. Isn't that a little hypocritical?"
Being Patriotic,"The former secretary of state's chain of lies continues and seems like not going to end. This Tuesday Hillary Clinton dared to state we have no immigration crisis and things are just fine with invader policy. ""I think we've done a really good job securing the border,"" she declared.        Well, that's her strategy — keep lying over and over until all her words become true (which is never). Or maybe by ""good job"" she meant Obama's Government provided Hillary's sponsors like Wall-Mart Corporation with low- paid illegal workers? If one day God lets this liar enter the White House as a president — that day would be a real national tragedy."
Being Patriotic,"Hillary Clinton made new promises to extend our traitor President Obama's pro-immigration policy. She also promised to offer illegals residency and ""a path of citizenship"". During the debate on 8th March she was asked about deportation.       Clinton said: ""I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe."" Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind this world ""children"" — young men who claim to be less than 18. Same way the ""illegals without a criminal record"" is also those who are not proved to be criminals yet. Crossing the U.S. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that should bring just one simple punishment — deportation and a prohibition of further entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that. We do not need a president who forgives this kind of crime. We do not need Hillary."
Being Patriotic,"This Monday Clinton had a public interview event where she was asked to tell about Iraq war and Intervention in Libya during her being as a secretary of state. After attacks in Benghazi, after her actions and lies caused a national scandal, after officially being caught on lies she afforded herself to make a statement ""I've said Iraq was a mistake. Libya was a different kind of calculation. And we didn't lose a single person.""        More than three years passed after the accident and still Clinton didn't even contact Benghazi victims' families. She didn't even try to ask for excuse, like those murdered Americans don't even exist. We definitely don't need a President who lies without a twinge of conscience. Luckily most Americans won't trust such an obvious liar."

United Muslims of America,"Religious leaders joined local organizations in rallying support for two men who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St. That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus. One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous. They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money. When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this country,"" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?"" The incident ""escalated really quick,"" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down. He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" and screaming, ""We'll make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!"""

United Muslims of America,"It was a powerful moment in an America that has seen hate crimes against Muslim Americans triple since November. In an America where the Republican political party had a 44% very unfavorable view of Islam, despite 78% of the same Republican respondents saying they neither worked with nor had any Muslim friends. according to a YouGov poll conducted from 6 -9 March, 2015. In an America where failed businessman and top contender for the GOP nomination Donald Trump has publicly and unapologetically called for widespread surveillance on mosques, mass deportations, denial of asylum to all Muslims and has lauded a plan to shoot Muslims with bullets covered in pigs blood. So when Bernie Sanders acts like a human being and commits his prospective presidency (not to mention entire career) to combatting racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Muslim Americans overwhelmingly support his bid for the White House."

Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed.

For example, Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3 percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be suspended from school.

Being Patriotic,"Remember that terrible case when a student was forced by York Comprehensive High School officials to remove the Old Glory from his pickup? It happened in May 2015 and luckily had a happy end, as a result the students were allowed to attach our flag to their vehicles.       The story ended well by efforts of dozens of patriots united to protest against High School authorities. It was a peaceful but strong and confident protest that made the authorities listen, it was a great example of how conscious people should act. We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks on American values and Constitutional laws. Unfortunately our current Government approves and even provokes these attacks, and the liberals' offensive and violent moods make it clear — every American patriot has to be careful and attentive."

Neither the VA officials nor our military commanders helped our Marines and now they just feel abandoned. Bob Miranda-Boulay said ̀I don't count' — that is what our veterans feel. That is not an attitude they deserve. ""I wanted to make a difference,"" Boulay said. ""I love my country and I wanted to do the right thing. I wanted to be a Marine.""

Detective Lancaster was a U.S Air Force veteran and had served with the Kansas City Police Department for 10 years. Honor to our hero; may his soul Rest in Peace.

We must resist the liberal propaganda accusing our cops in all deadly sins and we must keep on repeating our policemen are real heroes. It is important to rely on our police especially on the back of recent rising wave of liberal violent protests — our cops become the only guardians to protect us against rage and violence of hateful crowds.

Why does she call herself a Democrat, her anti-American ambitions are more likely to look like socialism and tyranny, not even close to Democracy.

When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too. The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals?

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them. FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the officers involved in Bethea's death. There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20 minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in prison for murder. America, it's not a black or white problem... but a blue one."

Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless.        The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125. The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon. To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive. For more stories, join our new brand site http://donotshoot.us/"

They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it.

Secured Borders,"His failed medical reform and unbelievable national debt is enough to put Obama behind bars. but that's not all. His greatest ""accomplishment"" is flooding America with countless criminals and giving them all an absolute omnipotence. Thanks to Barack Hussein Obama we have at least one big terror attack each year; not to mention illegals raging out and poisoning our country with drugs. For what he did to America Obama should rot in prison for the rest of his life."
Stop AI,1 cannot understand why democrats encourage breaking the law. They harbor illegal aliens who are breaking our immigration and labor laws. They praise rioters and vandals... What's wrong with them?

Born Liberal,"The US-led coalition strike in Syria's Raqqa province killed 12 women, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning. The second coalition strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%. However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008."
Industry,Forever grateful!
Stop AI,"Illegals think they are proprietors in America. They think that, since there are so many of them in America, we can't deport them all. So let's show them what American law is capable of, when fully enforced! Let's elect Trump and watch their sorry asses being deported all over Americal"
Born Liberal,"New administration's budget proposal to Congress includes $1.7 trillion in mandatory spending cuts over 10 years, including $800 billion from Medicaid and $193 billion from food stamps. At the same time, this proposal, called ""A New Foundation for American Greatness"", includes a boost in military spending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico. To be honest, I'm not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our focus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get more money for their wars, and they don't mind it if average Americans live in poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our Department of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the next eight countries combined, isn't it enough? Here is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Based on what we know about this budget, the good news -- the only good news -- is that it's likely to be roundly rejected by members of both parties here in the Senate — just as the last budget was"""
Born Liberal,"The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for 2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31 % cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high- powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria. Start thinking!"
Stop AI,No more mosques! We have to protect American culture!
Stop AI,19 times!!!That's why we need a wall. What used to be a nightmare for our country several decades ago is rapidly turning real. It all will definitely get even worse if we keep doing nothing and letting the invaders do all they want. This wrongful attitude of carelessness has to be changed!
Stop AI,"Like = yes. Share = hell, yeah! Ignore = no."
Stop AI,"Putting all other things and reasons aside, bombing Syria could lead a huge increase in number of refugees who would try to get to Europe and America. May be it would be better for America if our government concentrates on securing on borders and stops spending so much money on military operations.        Some of our enemies are way closer than Syria, so we need a wall to keep them out! This should be a priority, not making refugee camps in Mexico bigger and bigger by bombing Syria."
Stop AI,"This invasive war cult has no place in any civilized society! America, as the land of the free, should ban Sharia on federal level!"
